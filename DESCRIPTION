Description: Quantifies United States flood impacts at the county level using
    United States Geological Service (USGS) River Discharge data for the USGS
    API. This package builds on R packages from the USGS, with the goal of
    creating county-level time series of flood status that can be more easily
    joined with county-level impact measurements, including health outcomes.
